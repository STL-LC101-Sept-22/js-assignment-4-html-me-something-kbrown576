      <p><main>Have you ever seen something so cute that you just wanted to squeeze it? Ever seen a cute animal and told your significant other, "I Want One."? Have you later learned that either that thing is terribly scared of humans, dangerous, or just too far away?</main></p>

      <p1>I find myself regularly telling my daughter or significant other "No, we can't have one." Because i like to see their reactions, this list is compiled for them and people like them to find more cute things that they can't have.</p1>

      <h3>#1: The Slow Loris:</h3>
      <img src="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-07-07/Primates-in-jeopardy-The-innocent-but-poisonous-slow-loris-RVFwAlw0F2/img/8228b2a471754440b7eb90d39cac8ea8/8228b2a471754440b7eb90d39cac8ea8-1280.jpeg">

      <p2>The Slow Loris looks very nice to cuddle, and has extremely gentle eyes. Unfortunately for potential cuddlers, the Slow Lowis is actually venmous. If they feel threatened, they can and will mix toxins into their saliva and fur. Symptoms of this veom include nausea, shortness of breath, agitation, adominable pain, and anaphylactic shock. If biten: seek medical help immediately.</p2>

      <h4>#2: The Blue Octopus:</h4>

      <p3>Okay, maybe you dont think the Blue Ringed Octopus is cute and huggable, but somebody does, and thats why its here. If you are bit by one of these lovely creatures, you can expect symptoms such as: chest tightness, numbness in the mouth, face and neck, heart failure, respiratory arrest, blindeness, total paralysis, and of course, DEATH.</p3>
